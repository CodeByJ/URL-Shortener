# URL-Shortener

The URL-Shortener-Without-API program recreates a URL-shortening service like TinyURL.com (such a service takes a URL such as https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-5g-128gb-alpine-green-t-mobile/6487447.p?skuId=6487447 and returns a shortened url such as http://tinyurl.com/XqEJU7)

The URL-Shortener-Using-API program is similar to URL-Shortener-Without-API but uses gotiny api https://github.com/robvanbakel/gotiny-api
